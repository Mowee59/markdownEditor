# In Browser Markdown Editor
### /!\ Early WIP

A simple markdown editor. I'm still working on it, I just published it for anyone to follow the progression.
It aims to bo a full stack CRUD app, fully responsive and ablle to handle Authentification.
For now state is implementend, but no interactions except for the current file.
