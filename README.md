# In Browser Markdown Editor
Using React and Vite
## /!\ Early WIP

### [Try it on vercel](https://markdown-editor-6zyuqul9y-mowee59s-projects.vercel.app)

A simple markdown editor. I'm still working on it, I just published it for anyone to follow the progression.
It is not feature ocmplete and has not been refactored.
It aims to bo a full stack CRUD app, fully responsive and ablle to handle Authentification.
For now state is implementend, but no interactions except for the current file.
